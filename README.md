# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ariel Fruchter.
## Who Am I?
- I'm a full stack developer at the beginning of my career, with lots of love for code, learning, knowledge of any kind, and personal development.
- Here on github you can see the abilities and professional qualities that I bring with me.
- I specialize in building end-to-end web applications, in MERN Stack technologies, and like to look at things from an architectural and planning point of view. 
- Beyond that, I like to work in a group, grow my head and excel in everything I do. I come with humility and listening to learn and develop from everyone.
- Looking for my next position as a full stack /frontend /backend developer.
## About My Journy 
- I started my journey about a year ago, self-learning HTML, CSS and JS. 
- Out of curiosity, which quickly turned into love, I contacted one of the development experts in Israel, Yaniv Arad, and under his guidance I built a number of interesting end-to-end projects using MERN Stack technologies.
- The projects were built while setting schedules and setting goals, since I am married with a family, and also still serve in the IDF.
- Despite the great challenge, after efforts and many white nights, I saw results, and some of them are presented to you here.
- Now I am nearing the end of my military service (less than two months), and am looking for a place to integrate into the industry.
