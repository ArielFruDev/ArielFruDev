# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ariel Fruchter.
## About Me
- I am a **Full Stack Developer** with 2 years of experience in frontend and backend development, specializing in **MERN stack** technologies.
- I have a strong foundation in **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Node.js** for building end-to-end web applications, with solid experience in both **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases.
- At my current position at **Kan11 - Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation**, I am responsible for developing and maintaining a corporate transportation system used by over 400 users, ensuring its functionality 24/7.
- I am familiar with the **CI/CD process**, collaborative teamwork using **Git**, and deploying and managing **Docker** environments on **Windows** and **Linux** servers.
- I enjoy tackling all stages of development, from gathering customer requirements to final production, and I thrive in challenging environments where continuous learning and improvement are key.
- I am currently looking for my next position as a **Full Stack**, **Frontend**, or **Backend Developer** to continue contributing to meaningful and innovative projects.
## My Journey
- My journey began with self-learning **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Soon after, I joined a 400+ hour **Full Stack Web Development program** focusing on the **MERN stack**, where I built several end-to-end projects under the mentorship of **Yaniv Arad**.
- During this time, I developed the ability to manage multiple projects and meet deadlines, all while balancing my responsibilities with my military service.
- After my training, I joined **Kan11**, where I have gained valuable experience in managing large-scale systems and working collaboratively within a small, high-quality development team.
